## Building the client

The client is built using the [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) JavaScript runtime. To build the client, you need to have Node
installed on your machine. You can download it from the official NodeJS website.
Once you have it installed, you can build the client by running the following command in the root directory of the
project:

```bash
yarn install
yarn build
```
